/*Derived Class Constructor & Destructor


You are making a Quiz game. The Quiz class inherits from the Game base class.
Both classes have constructors, which output a Start message.
Create destructors for each class, which will output "Game Over" in the Game class, and "Quiz Over" in the Quiz class, so that when the program executes, it outputs:
Game Started
Quiz Started
Quiz Over
Game Over

#include <iostream>

class Game
{
    public:
    Game() {
        cout <<"Game Started"<<endl;
    }
    //destructor goes here
    ~Game(){
        cout<<"Game Over"<<endl;
